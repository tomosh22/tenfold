# Stress test results (W9)

Each W9 corpus agent adds its own self-contained section below. Format and rules of the corpora: `docs/TESTING.md`.

## Corpus findings: name lookup and OOP (W9d)

Six hand-written projects under `tests/corpus/`, expectations written from the C++ rules (what a correct IDE must answer),
not from tenfold's output. 1080 expectations in total; every kind is used (`def decl typedef impl refs hover sym rename`,
`fast`, `xfail`, `open`/`edit`; `config` is not used, it needs a Visual Studio project and is about configurations, not
lookup). Every project has its own `compile_commands.json` (`@CORPUS_ROOT@`, `-std=c++20`).

| project | what it stresses | expectations (pass / xfail) | fast==final on def/decl | runtime (Release) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `lookup-namespaces` | nested and `a::b::c` namespaces, namespace aliases, inline namespace versioning, anonymous namespaces and `static` functions with equal names in two TUs, using-declarations (header), using-directives (function scope), unsaved edit | 116 (96 / 20) | 8/59 | 1-2 s |
| `lookup-adl` | ADL for free functions and operators, hidden friends, the `using lib::swap; swap(a,b)` idiom, derived-hides-base, `using Base::f`, member-hides-global, local-hides-member, friends declared in a class and defined later, using-directive reached by a qualified name, unsaved edit | 118 (106 / 12) | 4/59 | 1-2 s |
| `oop-virtual` | pure/virtual/override/final, interfaces with several implementations across files, multiple inheritance (one override implementing two interfaces), virtual-inheritance diamond, covariant returns, calls through base pointers/references, member pointers, pimpl (`Impl` twice), `this->` in dependent bases, CRTP, unsaved new override | 193 (172 / 21) | 10/82 | 2-5 s |
| `oop-ctors` | default/explicit/delegating/copy/move/inherited (`using Base::Base`) constructors, destructors (`~T`, explicit call), conversion operators and implicit conversions to user types, enum vs enum class with equal enumerators, bit-fields, unions (named and anonymous), statics declared in class and defined in a .cpp, nested and local classes named `Node`, range-for over a custom container | 234 (220 / 14) | 15/123 | 2-6 s |
| `lambdas-bindings` | captures (copy, ref, init-capture, `[=]`, `[this]`, `[*this]`), generic lambdas, IIFE, lambdas in `std::function`/`auto`, parameter hiding an outer variable, structured bindings named like members, `std::optional`/`std::variant`/`std::visit` with `overloaded`, member and ADL `begin`/`end`, unsaved edit | 200 (188 / 12) | 22/98 | 25-35 s (parsing `<functional>`, `<variant>`, `<map>`) |
| `name-collisions` | `Node`, `Impl`, `get`, `size`, `Id`, `i`, `n` in many namespaces/classes/TUs, forward declarations in several headers, uses through incomplete types, `friend class Impl` naming a different class per namespace, a function named like a struct (`struct Stat` / `Stat()`), global `log` vs `log_ns::log`, same loop variables in neighbouring functions | 219 (196 / 23) | 7/114 | 3-4 s |

Five consecutive Release runs of `tenfold-corpus-tests` and one ASan+UBSan run: PASS and XFAIL only, counts identical in every
run. The only order-sensitive spot is documented in "Determinism" below.

### Findings

"Fault" says whose behaviour is wrong; where clangd is involved it was queried directly over LSP (clangd 22.1.1, all files
open, background index settled) to separate clangd from tenfold's handling of the answer. In no case was tenfold's own
handling of a clangd answer the cause: every wrong final answer below is already wrong in clangd.

| # | expectation (project) | expected | actual | tier | fault | minimal repro |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | every `xfail fast def` in all six projects (e.g. `lookup-namespaces:use_inner_value`, `name-collisions:use_a_Node_get`, `lookup-adl:use_draw_circle`) | the one declaration C++ lookup picks | every same-named definition in the workspace (all namespaces, classes, overloads, forward declarations) | fast | fast tier (design: name-only lexer index, no scope, receiver type, ADL or overload step) | `namespace a{int f();} namespace b{int f();} int g(){return b::f();}` : `fast def` on `f` returns both |
| 2 | `lambdas-bindings:use_cap_base`, `use_param_n`, `use_outer_n`, `use_sb_x`, `use_init_y`, `use_e_loop`, `use_lam_x`, `use_sb_inner_y`, `edit_use_b` | the local/parameter/capture/binding | none | fast | fast tier: locals, parameters, captures, init-captures, structured bindings and range-for variables are not indexed | `auto [x,y]=p; return x;` : `fast def` on `x` is empty |
| 3 | `name-collisions:use_i_a1`, `use_param_i` | loop variable `i` / parameter `i` | the unrelated member `Holder::i` | fast | fast tier: with no local scope a same-named member of another class is answered, which is worse than no answer | `int sum(int n){for(int i=0;i<n;++i);} struct H{int i;};` : `fast def` on the `i` in the loop gives `H::i` |
| 4 | `lookup-adl:use_dot`, `fast sym "dot"` | the hidden friend `dot` | none (no symbol, no definition) | fast | fast tier: friend functions defined inside a class are not extracted | `struct V{ friend int dot(V,V){return 0;} };` : `fast sym "dot"` is empty |
| 5 | `oop-ctors:use_Feet_to_Meters` | the conversion operator | none | fast | fast tier: conversion operators (`operator T`) are not indexed | `struct F{ operator int() const; }; f.operator int();` |
| 6 | `oop-virtual:use_Engine`, `oop-ctors:use_dtor_call` | the class `Engine`; the destructor `~Widget` | the class plus all constructors and the destructor | fast | fast tier: the word `Engine`/`Widget` is looked up, so class, ctors and dtor are conflated; `~Widget` is not distinguished from `Widget` | `class E{E(); ~E();}; E e;` : `fast def` on the type gives 3 results |
| 7 | `lookup-adl:refs hf_dot`, `refs hf_plus`, `rename hf_dot` | references include the ADL call `dot(a,b)` / `a + b`; rename changes it | only the declaration; rename leaves the call (broken code) | final | clangd (index has no references to hidden friends; `definition` works) | `struct V{friend int dot(V,V){return 0;}}; int f(V a){return dot(a,a);}` : references/rename of `dot` |
| 8 | `lookup-namespaces:refs outer_Node` (exact), `rename outer_Node` | the use `app::Node n;` (through `namespace app{using outer::Node;}`) is a reference and is renamed | the use through the using-declaration is missing, rename leaves it (the code no longer compiles) | final | clangd (functions through a using-declaration work, classes do not) | `namespace o{struct N{};} namespace a{using o::N;} a::N n;` : rename `o::N` |
| 9 | `lookup-namespaces:typedef var_n` | the class `outer::Node` | the class and additionally the using-declaration | final | clangd | same as 8, `typeDefinition` on `n` |
| 10 | `oop-virtual:impl Shape_area =`, `impl Shape_name =`, `impl Shape_clone =`, `impl Shape =`, `impl Animal =` | all overriders / all derived classes, including indirect ones (`Square::area` overrides `Rect::area` which overrides `Shape::area`; `Duck : Walker : virtual Animal`) | only direct ones | final | clangd (`findImplementations` is one level) | `struct S{virtual void f();}; struct R:S{void f()override;}; struct Q:R{void f()override;};` : implementations of `S::f` lacks `Q::f` |
| 11 | `oop-virtual:rename Readable_size` | renaming `Readable::size` also renames `Writable::size` and `NullStream::size`, because `Buffer::size` overrides both | `Writable::size`/`NullStream::size` and their calls are kept; `Buffer::size` no longer overrides `Writable::size` | final | clangd | `struct R{virtual int size()const=0;}; struct W{virtual int size()const=0;}; struct B:R,W{int size()const override;};` : rename `R::size` |
| 12 | `oop-ctors:refs List_begin = List_begin range_list` | the implicit `begin()`/`end()` of a range-for count as references (location convention: the range expression; debatable) | not reported | final | clangd (debatable) | `for (auto& n : list)` : references of `List::begin` |

Observations that are not wrong answers but shape the expectations (all pass):

* Go to definition on a name introduced by a using-declaration answers the using-declaration **and** the entity (accepted
  as `using_x | entity`). `def` on the type name of a constructor call (`Widget(2)`, `new Widget(5)`, a mem-initializer) answers the class, not the
  constructor (accepted as `Widget | Widget_ctor_int`). Both choices are open questions, see below.
* `refs` on a virtual function answers the whole override family up and down one level, with calls through the base; the
  corpora use `>=` for those. `refs` on conversion operators and converting constructors does include the *implicit* use sites.
* Workspace symbols answer the *definition* location when a symbol has one (`sym "call" ∋ v1_call_def`), and match on the
  unqualified name unless the query is scope-qualified (`sym "deep::er::est::make"`; `sym "est_make"` finds nothing).
* Hover on a member names only the immediate class (`In Node`), not the namespace: `a::Node::get` and `b::Node::get` can be told apart only by the
  "provided by" file.
* clangd rejects a rename that collides with another symbol (`invalid name: conflict with the symbol ...`), good.
* `rename` on an `operator==` declaration answers "no symbol at the given location" (clangd refuses to rename operators); not asserted.

### Determinism

* Cross-TU answers (definition in another TU, `impl`, `refs`) need clangd's background index; the runner waits for it before
  the first final query, and all six projects gave identical counts in 5 + 1 runs.
* After an `edit`, clangd's dynamic index takes a moment to learn the new text. A `impl` asked **immediately** after inserting a new
  override does not see it. `oop-virtual` therefore asks `impl ... edit_area` after other queries; verified by LSP that the
  override is returned once the open document has been indexed. If this ever flakes, move those three lines further down.
* `lambdas-bindings` takes 25-35 s because three std headers are parsed by clangd on a loaded machine; the other projects take
  1-6 s. Well under the 60 s per-project budget.

### Open questions

1. What should go to definition answer for a name brought in by a using-declaration: the entity only, or both (clangd)? Accepted both.
2. What should go to definition answer on the type name in a constructor call: the class or the selected constructor? Accepted both;
   VS and CLion jump to the constructor.
3. Are the implicit `begin()`/`end()` of a range-for references to those functions? Pinned only as an `xfail`.
4. Is "references of an overriding function include the base's declaration and calls through the base" the wanted behaviour?
   Pinned loosely (`>=`).
